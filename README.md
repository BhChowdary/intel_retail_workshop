# Intel Retail Workshop Setup Guide
Welcome to the Intel® Retail Workshop. In this workshop, we will explore Intel® OpenVINO™ through lectures and hands on labs. By the end of the workshop, you should have a solid understanding of Intel® OpenVINO™ toolkit and have some working ideas of how to implement them in your video analytics applications.
## How Do I Use the Lab Material
The links below will guide the workshop attendee through slides and labs in the Visual Retail Workshop using Intel® OpenVINO™ toolkit.

## Hardware Used in this Workshop
Intel offers scalable hardware solutions at different power, performance and price points. During these labs we will be using OPS Device.

**OPS device**                                                 
Intel launched the Open Pluggable Specification (OPS) to standardize the system architecture between displays and media players. OPS allows for more cost-effective design, deployment, and management of digital signage and other display solutions that support advanced functionality and emerging use cases, including interactivity and anonymous audience analytics.

As OPS has quickly become a standard for creating integrated display solutions, Intel is providing the industry with OPS+, offering future-proofed capabilities targeted at higher resolution content and additional use cases.
### OPS Key Features
- 180 mm x 119 mm x 30 mm, fully enclosed.
- Enhanced thermal design supports broader range of Intel® processors.
- Enables new and customizable functionality through an additional connector interface that can be enhanced further with Intel® FPGAs.
- Optimized for interactive white boards (IWBs), commercial digital signage, kiosks, visual data devices, video walls, and more.
- Ability to customize a protocol and simultaneously support advanced use cases including real-time analytics and video capture performed on the display itself.
- Features a second high-speed connector and is backward compatible with previous OPS specifications.
